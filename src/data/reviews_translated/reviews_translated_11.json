  "Manuel is a great teacher and you can tell he knows a lot.

  "It is not an in-depth class on Roman Law, but the necessary knowledge is achieved with a judicious reading of the book. In Cifuentes's class, you can understand the meaning of Roman Law and what the thought of Roman jurisconsults was like, all this accompanied by wisdom of life with a lot of humor.": [

Literally the people he withdraws go to more classes than he does. Pros: It knows a lot. Great person. Entertaining cases.Cons: Disorganized and does not deliver the corrected works. The monitor never goes to class.": [

It is one of those few classes that reflects on the State, society, the role of criminal law, among others. Although it is almost three hours in a row, you are not going to waste your time.
