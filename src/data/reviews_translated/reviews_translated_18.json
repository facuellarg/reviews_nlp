  "Only by being able to pass without attending classes is it known that it is a bad course. Hugo does not generate a passion for reading nor is he clear with what he wants. The difficulty of passing the subject depends on the monitor that he has because he does not grade anything, sometimes I asked him about some work and he did not make any corrections and then the monitor ...

  "I had a lot of fun in this class that, more than teaching me about the texts of the historical moment, taught me to read differently, to work the texts from different details and perspectives. It was very valuable to me.\nIn general, they can pass it if they write exactly what he says in class in the works, which is good, because attendance is compulsory (they take a list)\n\nPros: Passing assignments is very easy if you pay attention to the class.\nHugo is hilarious and loves those texts.Cons: They take the list and the monitor is very cute with it (don't be late)\nIf Hugo sees them on the cell phone or chatting, he will take at least 5 minutes to talk about their ineptitude, how they spend their parents' money or a very expensive scholarship to come and do nothing. Do not do it.\n\nHe has to be aware of his progress on his own, he is rather disinterested in his students.": [

Pros: You learn many autonomous work tools and if you have a particular interest in the subject, it is a very enriching course, especially if you take advantage of the hours of operation and the recommended bibliography. : Neither he nor the monitors that I had in the class left photocopies of the primary material and, although it is in the library, very few copies (or just one) are not in the reserve collection, so if there is a student who takes the book the entire course runs out of material": [
