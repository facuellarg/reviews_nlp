  "That DALGO with cardoso is impossible is a myth. The class is passable just by attending class and if the readings are made it can easily be left at 4. Something negative is that he is one of the worst people when giving a class, since he literally does not care about his students. The best thing is to go to classes and not ask or anything because he will not answer ap ... Read more ... Pros: -The class is easier than difficult.\n-It does not take attendance and it does not matter if a student goes or not.

  "The teacher is really very bad. Unfortunately it is what it is and the department is not going to change it. You ask him questions and the man criticizes his question, but then he gets angry that no one asks questions, and if you do not understand a statement well in a partial, Paila, you are not going to explain it to him.": [

  "The worst teacher I've ever messed with all my career. If you value your money, time, and math, don't mess with it. His class notes use rather strange notation and are difficult to understand. I felt that I did not learn anything and decided to withdraw the subject that although it is very exciting and beautiful, the teacher makes it unbearable. If you ... Read more ...": [

  "Rodrigo is a doctor who knows extremely well, during his class we saw algorithms that no one would have thought of it that way, he has a characteristic way of structuring problems and solving them. But he lacks humanity, he is sparing as a person, he does not answer the students' questions because his answer is: \"trivial\", and sometimes he responds with ... Read more ... Pros: He understands his subject, he knows a little about everything, It is very cultured Cons: I would say that he does not prepare the classes, whenever the videovid did not work he stagnated for not having his presentations, he limited himself to showing what was in the notes, that they do not understand anything, he confused himself at the time of do an example of an exercise.": [

  "As several people have already mentioned, Rodrigo is a person who shows that he knows a lot about the subject that he explains in DAlgo and when reading the HV, all the knowledge he has acquired over time can be evidenced. Even so, after giving the DAlgo course since about the year 2000, Rodrigo comes to class with an attitude of dictating the c ... Read more ...
