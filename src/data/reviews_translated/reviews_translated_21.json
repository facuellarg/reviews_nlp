  "Paul is very kind but he explains quite badly, the truth one does not understand what he is talking about. So people stop going to class about the third week. His partials are not so easy, especially considering how little is understood. However if you study on your own, or go to another master, partials can be manageable. Pros: KindCons: You don't understand\nPartial means": [

  "As a teacher he is very good, he is passionate about mathematics but when it comes to understanding the language it becomes a barrier, however if you have prepared a subject previously you can follow the thread with what follows despite the disorderPros: Try to help in the end as long as you see commitment\nPartials and maybe very easy if the exercises of the program are solved Cons: A little messy": [

  "He is a very intelligent teacher and it shows that he knows what he is talking about, and it is also difficult for him to explain the subject in a friendly way. He is available in the office to answer questions and has a very good attitude when you have any doubts and makes sure you understand. Pros: Good people Cons: Speak English (bad for those who do not know intermediate English)": [

  "Explain the topics as detailed as possible. The pace of the class is determined by the participation of the students. Solve doubts and is always available for advice. He was the first teacher with whom I learned this subject. Pros: The partials are simple but somewhat long. Pay close attention as mistakes go down a lot of points.\n\nThe note of workshops and maybe helps a lot. Cons: It did not take into account some participation points to raise the grade of the last partial.": [

  "One of the best complements I have ever had. She is clear in her explanations (so much so that she is understood more than many teachers of the magistrales), she worries that her students understand the issues, she is attentive to her emails and she is a very good person. Pros: - Very good person\n- Very clear explanations\n- If you pay attention, it can be left very high.": [

  "It is the best complementary I have ever had, it really cares about people understanding the issues and not about making meaningless maybe.\nIn general it explains very well, in some subjects it can get tangled but as it has prepared the class realizes very quickly the errors.\nPros: Very flexible\nExplain well\nAnswer questions": [
