I am sure that the complexity could go down a bit and achieve the same level of learning.\n- It's not his fault, but that class at 6:30 is deadly.\n- Sometimes the presentations don't go up.\n- Sometimes he makes comments that make one feel \"gross\". It is openly hostile to industrialists.\n- Sometimes he brags about being \"bad\" saying things like that in every semester some girl has come crying from the exams.\n- In particular it bothered me a lot when in the practicals he began to talk to the monitors about \"how easy it is\".\n- Since it is not a plant, it is difficult to get it for questions outside of class and touch everything by mail.": [
